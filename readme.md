This is the repository for my bookings and reservation project.I created this project by following [Go course from udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/).

- Built in Go version 1.17
- Uses the [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) router
- Uses [alex edwards SCS](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs) session management
- Uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)
